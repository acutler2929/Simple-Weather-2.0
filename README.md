## A Minimalist Weather App

This is a remake of my first Simple Weather app, meant to familiarize myself with React. As in the previous version; you enter your city and state, and it returns weather for the hour, day and week from Open Weather Map API.
You can find my app on my portfolio [alicecutler.dev](https://alicecutler.dev/).
